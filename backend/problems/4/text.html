<p>Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.</p>

<p>You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.</p>

 

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]</p>
<p>Output: 3</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]</p>
<p>Output: 99</p>
 

<p>Constraints:</p>

<p>1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104</p>
<p>-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1</p>
<p>Each element in nums appears exactly three times except for one element which appears once.</p>
