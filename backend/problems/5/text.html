<p>A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.</p>

<p>Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.</p>

<p>You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.</p>

<p>You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.</p>

 

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]</p>
<p>Output: 2</p>
<p>Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]</p>
<p>Output: 5</p>
<p>Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.</p>
 

<p>Constraints:</p>

<p>1 <= nums.length <= 1000</p>
<p>-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1</p>
<p>nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.</p>
