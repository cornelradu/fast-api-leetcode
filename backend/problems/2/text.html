<p>Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.</p>

 

<p>Example 1:</p>

<p>Input: x = 121</p>
<p>Output: true</p>
<p>Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>

<p>Input: x = -121</p>
<p>Output: false</p>
<p>Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</p>
<p>Example 3:</p>

<p>Input: x = 10</p>
<p>Output: false</p>
<p>Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.</p>
 

<p>Constraints:</p>

<p>-231 <= x <= 231 - 1</p>
 

<p>Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?</p>
